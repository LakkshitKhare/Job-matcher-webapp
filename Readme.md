A full-stack MVP project that helps users find the most relevant job listings and generate tailored CV summaries — powered by AI and your resume.

[🔗 Live Demo (Streamlit)](https://job-matcher-webapp.onrender.com)  
[🧪 API Docs (FastAPI backend)](https://job-matcher-webapp.onrender.com/docs)

## 🚀 Features

### 📄 Resume Parsing
- Upload your resume (PDF).
- Automatically extract skills, experience, and other relevant data using `PyMuPDF` and `spaCy`.

### 🔍 Job Matching
- Fetches **real-time job listings** using the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch).
- Matches jobs based on your resume content using a cosine similarity scoring system.

### ✨ AI-Based CV Summary Generation
- Uses the **Gemini Pro API** to generate customized CV paragraphs for each job listing.
- Tailored summaries boost your chances of selection in Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

### 🌐 Frontend & Backend
- **Frontend:** Built with Streamlit (lightweight and interactive UI).
- **Backend:** FastAPI handles parsing, matching, and AI integration logic.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User uploads PDF resume** via Streamlit frontend.
2. **Backend parses** the resume → extracts data.
3. User **inputs a job description** or chooses from live job listings.
4. **Cosine similarity** is calculated between the resume and each job.
5. Top job matches are returned and **CV summaries are generated** for each.
